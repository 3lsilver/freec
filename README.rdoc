= About
Freec is a framework you can build voice applications on top of. It makes use of the Event socket outbound API of Freeswitch.

= Installation
  sudo gem install jankubr-freec

= Usage
1. Install Freeswitch and point a chosen extension to the IP where your app will run:
  
  <extension name="telfa">
    <condition field="destination_number" expression="^.*$">
      <action application="socket" data="127.0.0.1:8084 async full" />
    </condition>
  </extension>
  
2. Create a file with the main class of your application (e.g. Jukebox) and make it a subclass of Freec. Name the file according to the class name (e.g. jukebox.rb). Implement
   a step method instructions for which will follow. Simple example:
 
  #jukebox.rb
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'freec'
  class Jukebox < Freec
    def step
      @step ||= 1
      case @step
        when 1
          answer
        when 2
          playback('music/8000/danza-espanola-op-37-h-142-xii-arabesca.wav')
        when 3
          return nil
      end
      @step += 1
    end
  end

3. Run it with:
  ruby jukebox.rb

= How does it work 
The step method is called after each even is finished (e.g. file is played, recording is finished). Here is what you can do:
* read call variables from the hash in call_vars
* call one of the following methods (Freeswitch apps):
 * answer
 * playback(path_to_file)
 * bridge(number_or_numbers)
 * record(path_to_file)
 * read(path_to_file)
 * set_variable(name, value)
 * any other via execute_app(app_name, params)
If you return nil or false from the step method, the call will be hungup.
  
= Cool stuff
* Your application's main file as well as everything you might have in the lib directory will be reloaded on each step in development mode.
* Passing -d will daemonize the application and automatically implies production mode. 
* The log directory contains the log file and the pid file.
* There is a hidden feature.

= Stinks?
What Freec can do at the moment was enough for me to implement Telfa (http://telfapbx.com). If it doesn't fit your needs, you can:
1. Complain to hi@jankubr.com .
2. Fork it and change yourself.
3. Check Liverpie (http://www.liverpie.com/) or Telegraph (http://code.google.com/p/telegraph/), Freec is inspired by them.
4. Write yours :-)
